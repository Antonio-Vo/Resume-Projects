PROJECT BRIEF: 

Goal:
Learn methods, switch statements, and error handling.
Skills Learned:
Writing methods for modular code
Using if,else if,else or switch to handle different operators
Basic error handling with try/catch
Looping to allow repeated calculations


Concept:
● User enters two numbers and an operator (+, -, ×, ÷).
● Program performs the operation and outputs the result.
● Program repeats until the user chooses to quit.


Checklist:
 ✔ Can write separate methods for each operation (+, -, ×, ÷)
 ✔ Can use if,else if,else or switch  to handle operators
 ✔ Can validate division by zero
 ✔ Can loop until the user quits
 ✔ Can handle invalid input with try/catch

Challenge:
● Add power and exponents (x², x^y)
● Add square root operations (√)
● Bonus Challenge (choose one):
● Add Advanced Operations:
● Add support for: Factorial and Percentages
● Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan).
