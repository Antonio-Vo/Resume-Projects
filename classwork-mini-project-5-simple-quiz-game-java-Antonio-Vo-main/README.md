## 📌 Project Requirements



## Java runtime requirement

This project targets Java 21 (latest LTS). To build or run the project locally, install JDK 21 and ensure `javac` and `java` on your PATH point to Java 21.

Quick local install options:

Using apt on Ubuntu (may provide OpenJDK 21 on newer Ubuntu releases):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-21-jdk
```

Using SDKMAN (recommended for multi-JDK management):

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install java 21-open
sdk use java 21-open
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

I also added a GitHub Actions workflow that will compile the project using JDK 21 on push and pull requests.
